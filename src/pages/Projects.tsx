    title: "Object-Detection by Ankit",
    description:
      "In this project, we developed an advanced object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its speed and accuracy. Object detection is a key application of computer vision, enabling machines to recognize and locate multiple objects within an image or video in real-time. YOLO stands out by performing detection in a single neural network pass, making it highly efficient for real-time applications. Our system is capable of identifying various objects within complex environments with remarkable precision. The project involves training the YOLO model on a labeled dataset, preprocessing images, and implementing techniques to enhance detection accuracy. This solution can be applied in fields like surveillance, traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and smart retail. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, our project demonstrates how YOLO can significantly contribute to intelligent visual recognition systems with practical, real-world applications.",

    title: "Flood-Evacuation-System",
    description:
      "This project focuses on optimizing flood evacuation routes using advanced pathfinding algorithms and web technologies. Developed using Python, it integrates algorithms such as A* (A-Star), Dijkstra's, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute the safest and shortest evacuation paths during flood scenarios. These algorithms analyze a grid-based map to avoid flood-prone zones and guide individuals toward safe locations efficiently. The backend logic processes geographical and flood data, while the frontend, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers an interactive interface to visualize routes and affected areas in real-time. Users can input flood conditions and receive optimized evacuation guidance on the map. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence, pathfinding techniques, and web development can be combined to address real-world problems like disaster management. It is especially useful for authorities and individuals in flood-prone regions, helping to reduce risks and improve emergency response times during critical situations.",
